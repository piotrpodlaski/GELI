	<!--
	Diffusion is simulated by smearing energy deposit in each bin into 3D gauss.
	Diffusion coefficient is a sigma of 3D gauss (in mm) which is a result of difussing point energy deposit. Coefficient depends on d (distance from the readout electrode). This dependence is linear:
	D(z)=D0+\alpha d
	In this equation D0 is diffusion coefficient ath the bottom of a chamber and \alpha is slope parameter, both D0 and \alha can be changed independently for all axes. Note, that in equation above d=0 is the top of the active volume.

	Attachment simulation is don by multiplying energy deposit by exponential decay in z described with equation:
	Edep=Edep*A_0*exp(-\beta d)
	In this equation is the distance from the readout electrode. A_0 is a constant describing energy deposit (charge) losses at z=0 (bottom of the active volume)
