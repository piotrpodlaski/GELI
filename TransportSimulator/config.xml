	<!--
	Diffusion is simulated by smearing energy deposit in each bin into 3D gauss.
	Diffusion coefficient is a sigma of 3D gauss (in mm) which is a result of difussing point energy deposit. Coefficient depends on z (amount of time that energy deposits spends in a chamber is a linear function of z coordinate). This dependence is linear:
	D(z)=D0+\alpha z
	In this equation D0 is diffusion coefficient ath the bottom of a chamber and \alpha is slope parameter, both D0 and \alha can be changed independently for all axes. Note, that in equation above z=0 is NOT the coordinate of the center of the detecotor. z=0 corresponds to place clostest to the readout electrode and grows further from it.
